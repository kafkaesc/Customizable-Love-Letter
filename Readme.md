# Customizable Love Letter

Love letter is a game of bluffing and deduction from AEG. The game itself is 
only $12 and available from 
[their website](http://www.alderac.com/tempest/love-letter/).

The first step in this project will be to create a playable version of Love 
Letter in the command line. After that it should be pretty simple to program a 
difficult computer opponent. The last step is to make the game easy to retheme, 
something that boardgame enthusiasts seem to love doing. By having the card 
titles load from a .txt file it should be possible to make it so that anyone 
can retheme the game.
